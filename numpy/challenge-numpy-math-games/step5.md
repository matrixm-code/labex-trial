# Euclidean Distance

The Euclidean distance is a measure of the straight-line distance between two points in Euclidean space. In this challenge, you are asked to write a function that takes two numpy arrays as inputs and returns the Euclidean distance between them using NumPy array operations.

Formula:

$$ euclidean_distance(a, b) = \sqrt(\(a-b\)^2)$$

## TODO

- Completing `euclidean_distance.py`

## Requirements

Write a function called euclidean_distance(a: np.ndarray, b: np.ndarray) -> float that takes two 1D numpy arrays, a and b, as inputs and returns the Euclidean distance between them.
