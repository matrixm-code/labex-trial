# Reshape

You need to create a function that reshapes a NumPy array. This means that the shape of the input array is changed, but the data is not.

## TODO

- Completing `reshape_array.py`

## Requirements

- Take a NumPy array and a shape as input.
- Reshape the array to the specified shape.
- Return the resulting array with the same data but a different shape.
