# Transpose

You need to create a function that transposes a NumPy array. This means that the rows of the input array become the columns of the output array, and vice versa.

## TODO

- Completing `transpose_array.py`

## Requirements

- Take two NumPy arrays as input.
- Transpose the array.
- Return the resulting array with the rows and columns swapped.
