# Elementwise Multiplication

You need to create a function that multiplies two NumPy arrays element-wise. This means that the corresponding elements of the two arrays will be multiplied to create a new array with the same shape.

## TODO

- Completing `multiply_arrays.py`

## Requirements

- Take two NumPy arrays as input.
- Multiply the arrays element-wise.
- Return the resulting array with the same shape as the input arrays.
