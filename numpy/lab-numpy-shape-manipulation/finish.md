# Summary

Congratulations! You have completed the NumPy Shape Manipulation Lab.

In this lab, you learned the NumPy shape manipulation functions `reshape`, `concatenate`, `stack`, `split`, and `transpose`. These functions allow you to manipulate the shape of NumPy arrays and are essential for many data manipulation tasks.
