# Data Aggregation
In this sub-challenge, you will aggregate the data to answer specific questions or derive insights about the dataset. Data aggregation involves grouping and summarizing data to reveal patterns or trends.

**TODO:**
1. Calculate the total revenue for each product using the Pandas `pandas.sum` and reset its index.
2. Calculate the average price per category using the Pandas `pandas.mean` and reset its index.
3. Find the top 10 products with the highest revenue using the Pandas `pandas.nlargest`.
4. Identify the season with the highest sales using the Pandas `pandas.loc`.


*returned values shoud be sequenced as total_revenue_per_product, avg_price_per_category, top_10_products, and highest_sales_season*

## Example

Challengers can run the data_aggregation.py file to verify the correctness of the code:
```
python3 data_aggregation.py
```
The data processing result is as follows:
