# Summary

This challenge uses a variety of flexbox properties to achieve the effect of fruit placement in the specified position.

The `justify-content` CSS property defines how the browser distributes space between and around content items along the main-axis of a flex container, and the inline axis of a grid container.

The `align-self` CSS property overrides a grid or flex item's align-items value. In Grid, it aligns the item inside the grid area. In flexbox, it aligns the item on the cross axis.

The `flex-direction` CSS property sets how flex items are placed in the flex container defining the main axis and the direction (normal or reversed).
