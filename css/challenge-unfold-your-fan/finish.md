# Summary

This challenge is about using CSS3 to create a fan-shaped expansion effect for a set of 12 identical div elements. We need to use `:hover` pseudo-classes to achieve the desired effect when the mouse is hovering over the element. The `rotate` function is used to rotate the elements, with the first six div elements rotating counter-clockwise with a minimum angle of 10 degrees and the next six elements rotating clockwise.
