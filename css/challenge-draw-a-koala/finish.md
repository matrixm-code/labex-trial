# Summary

This challenge is to test your mastery of grid layout by drawing a koala.

The grid CSS property is a shorthand property that sets all of the explicit and implicit grid properties in a single declaration.

The `grid-area` CSS shorthand property specifies a grid item's size and location within a grid by contributing a line, a span, or nothing (automatic) to its grid placement, thereby specifying the edges of its grid area.
