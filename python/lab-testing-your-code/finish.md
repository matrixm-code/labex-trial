# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to write unit tests for our Python code using the unittest module. We started with a simple function and then built up to testing more complex code, including code that interacts with databases. With this knowledge, you can write tests for your Python code to ensure that it works as expected and catches bugs early in the development process.
