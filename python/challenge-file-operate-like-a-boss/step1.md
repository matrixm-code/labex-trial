# Create What You Want

In this challenge, you should complete a function `folder_create` in `folder_create.py`. This function accepts a string input and creates a folder with this input.

for example:

```python
folder_create('first_folder')
# create a folder in current path
folder_create('/home/second_folder')
# create a folder in /home
```

## Requirements

- The path of `folder_create.py` is `/home/labex/project`, don't move it, and don't change the filename or function name.
- Do nothing if the folder already exists.
