# What Time Is It?

What's the time now?

Try to get the current time in the Python script `current_time.py`.

You should get the current time, and convert it to 'YYYY-mm-dd HH:MM' format, then print it to the console.

For example:

```bash
# if now is 2000-01-01 00:00
python current_time.py
# the script output
2000-01-01 00:00
```

## Requirements

- The path of `current_time.py` is `/home/labex/project`, don't move it or change the filename.
- Only `time` module can be used.
