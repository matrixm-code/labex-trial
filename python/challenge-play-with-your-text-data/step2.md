# High-Frequency Words

You have counted total numbers successfully, now you should find out the top 3 high-frequency words and print them in descending order by frequency in `top_3_high_frequencies.py`.

Such as follows:

```bash
python top_3_high_frequencies.py

# print word and frequency in console
word1 20
word2 15
word3 13
```

## Requirements

- The result should be `print` in the console when executing the Python script.
- Words are case-sensitive.
- Punctuations are not words.
