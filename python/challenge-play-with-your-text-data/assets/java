Java is a programming language and computing platform that was first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. It is a class-based, object-oriented language that is designed to be easy to use and read. Java is intended to be simple, portable, and easy to learn, and it is used for building a wide variety of applications, including web, mobile, and desktop applications. One of the main features of Java is its ability to run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine installed, regardless of the underlying hardware and operating system. This makes it a popular choice for developing applications that can be deployed on a variety of devices and platforms.
