Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. It is an interpreted language, which means that you can run a Python program by interpreting it at runtime, rather than compiling it ahead of time. Python is used in many different domains, including web development, scientific computing, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and education. It is a popular choice for beginners because it is easy to read and learn, and it has a large and active community of users who contribute a wide variety of libraries and frameworks that can be leveraged in your own projects.
