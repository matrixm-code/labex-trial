# Running Total Generator

Write a function `running_total` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a generator that yields the running total of the numbers in the input list.

## TODO

- Completing `running_total.py`

## Requirements

- The function should take a list of integers as input.
- The function should return a generator that yields the running total of the numbers in the input list.
- The generator should not store the entire list of running totals in memory. Instead, it should yield each running total one at a time.
