# Factorial Generator

Write a function `factorial` that takes an integer as input and returns a generator that yields the factorial of .

## TODO

- Completing `factorial.py`

## Requirements

- The function should take an integer n as input, where n is the number to compute the factorial of.
- The function should return a generator that yields the factorial of n.
- The generator should not store the entire list of intermediate products in memory. Instead, it should yield each intermediate product one at a time.
