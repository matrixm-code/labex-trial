# Square Numbers Generator

Write a function `square_numbers` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a generator that yields the square of each number in the input list.

## TODO

- Completing `square_numbers.py`

## Requirements

- The function should take a list of integers as input.
- The function should return a generator that yields the square of each number in the input list.
- The generator should not store the entire list of squares in memory. Instead, it should yield each square one at a time.
