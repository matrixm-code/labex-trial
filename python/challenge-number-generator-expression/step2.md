# Even Numbers Generator

Write a function `even_numbers` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a generator that yields only the even numbers from the input list.

## TODO

- Completing `even_numbers.py`

## Requirements

- The function should take a list of integers as input.
- The function should return a generator that yields only the even numbers from the input list.
- The generator should not store the entire list of even numbers in memory. Instead, it should yield each even number one at a time.
