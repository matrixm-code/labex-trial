# Sum Integers

Here is an unpythonic code in `sum_n.py` that takes an integer argument n and returns the sum of the first n integers.

Simplify this code pythonically.

## Requirements

- Less than 3 lines in `sum_n.py`, including `def` and `return` lines, excluding docstring.
- The symbol: `;` can't be used.
- The function return should be consistent with the unpythonic code.
