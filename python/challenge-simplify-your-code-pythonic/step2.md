# Concatenate Strings

Here is an unpythonic code in `concat_strings.py` that takes a list of strings as an argument.

Then the function concatenates all the strings in the list into a single string and returns the result.

Simplify the code pythonically.

# Requirements

- Less than 3 lines in `concat_strings.py`, including `def` and `return` lines, excluding docstring.
- The symbol: `;` can't be used.
- The function return should be consistent with the unpythonic code.
