# Sum Two Lists

Here is an unpythonic code in `sum_two_lists.py`, it takes in two lists of equal length, `list1` and `list2`, and returns a new list containing the element-wise sum of the two input lists.

Simplify the code pythonically.

# Requirements

- Less than 5 lines in `sum_two_lists.py`, including `def` and `return` lines, excluding docstring.
- The symbol: `;` can't be used.
- The function return should be consistent with the unpythonic code.
