# Get Grade

Here is an unpythonic code in `get_grade.py` that takes an integer score as input and returns a string grade based on the score. The grading system is as follows: scores 90 or above receive an 'A', scores 80 or above receive a 'B', scores 70 or above receive a 'C', scores 60 or above receive a 'D', and scores below 60 receive an 'E'.

Simplify the code pythonically.

# Requirements

- Less than 5 lines in `get_grade.py`, including `def` and `return` lines, excluding docstring.
- The symbol: `;` can't be used.
- The function return should be consistent with the unpythonic code.
