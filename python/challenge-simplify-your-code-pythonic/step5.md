# Flatten List

Here is an unpythonic code in `flatten_list.py`, it takes a nested list and converts it to a one-dimensional list.

Simplify the code pythonically.

# Requirements

- Less than 3 lines in `flatten_list.py`, including `def` and `return` lines, excluding docstring.
- The symbol: `;` can't be used.
- The function return should be consistent with the unpythonic code.
