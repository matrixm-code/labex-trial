# Even Numbers

Given a list of numbers, write a list comprehension that creates a new list containing only the `even numbers` from the original list.

The syntax of a list comprehension is:

```python
new_list = [out_expression for item in old_list if condition]
```

- `condition` is a boolean expression, in this step, we judge whether the `item` of old_list is an even number.

## TODO

- Completing `even_numbers.py`

## Requirements

- Use only the list comprehensions to solve the problem.
- No modules can be imported.
