# Names Starting with "A"

Given a list of names, write a list comprehension that creates a new list containing only the names that start with the letter "A".

The syntax of a list comprehension is:

```python
new_list = [out_expression for item in old_list if condition]
```

- `condition` is a boolean expression,in this step, we determine whether the `item` in old_list starts with the letter 'A'.

## TODO

- Completing `names_starting_with_a.py`

## Requirements

- Use only the list comprehensions to solve the problem.
- No modules can be imported.
