# Word Lengths

Given a list of words, write a list comprehension that creates a new list containing the `length` of each word in the original list.

The syntax of a list comprehension is:

```python
new_list = [out_expression for item in old_list]
```

- In this step,`out_expression` is a function that calculates the length of each `item`.

## TODO

- Completing `word_lengths.py`

## Requirements

- Use only the list comprehensions to solve the problem.
- No modules can be imported.
