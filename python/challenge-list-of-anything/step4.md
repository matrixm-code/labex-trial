# square of Numbers

Given a list of numbers, write a list comprehension that creates a new list containing the square of each number in the original list.

The syntax of a list comprehension is:

```python
new_list = [out_expression for item in old_list]
```

- In this step,`out_expression` is a function that calculates the square of each `item`.

## TODO

- Completing `square_of_numbers.py`

## Requirements

- Use only the list comprehensions to solve the problem.
- No modules can be imported.
