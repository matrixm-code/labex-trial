# Sentence Input and Split

Write a piece of code that can take an English sentence as input, and split the sentence string into a list of words using whitespace as a delimiter.

Here is an example:

```bash
Please enter an English sentenceï¼šIsn't it a pleasure to study and practice what you have learned?

return: ['it', 'a', 'pleasure', 'to', 'study', 'and', 'practice', 'what', 'you', 'have', 'learned']

```

## TODO

- Completing `split_sentence.py`

## Requirements

- Keep only the words with letters, remove punctuation, numbers, and words with non-letter characters.
- Convert all letters to lowercase.
- Remove duplicates, leaving only one occurrence of each word.
